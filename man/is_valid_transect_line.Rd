\title{Check if an updated transect line is valid relative to the other transects and flowlines in the network
The 'transect_to_check' should be 'used' (i.e. function returns TRUE) if
the 'transect_to_check' does NOT interesect any other transects ('transect_lines') AND it only intersects a single flowline ONCE.
If the 'transect_to_check' intersects ANY other transects OR intersects a flowline more
than once (OR more than one flowline in the network) then the function returns FALSE.}
